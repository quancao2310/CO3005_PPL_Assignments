# CO3005 - PPL - Assignments
This repository contains the specifications and my implementations of 4 PPL assignments in semester 232. The assignments are about creating a partial compiler for a simple, general-purposed procedural programming language - ZCode. All these assignments are correlated with each other, and each represent a step in implementing the ZCode compiler.

Here is the newest version of ZCode: [Spec](./ZCode_v1.2.2.pdf). The spec is changed over time to resolve ambiguity or any other problems regarding to language/compiler implementation.

## Assignment 1: Lexer/Parser

## Assignment 2

## Assignment 3

## Assignment 4
